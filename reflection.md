# reflection, major project, samin

## advice to self if i do a project like this again
    - ask more questions!! i needed a lot more help on this in order to finish
    - 

## hardest part of the project
- i was stuck on the zombie array for about a week, which i should have gotten done earlier and maybe i could have finished the project
- i may have thought i could do more then what i could but it was a fun and enjoyable experience, even though its not finished i am happy with what i made so far. and i am expecting to finish the project on my own and cant wait for that.


## did u complete needs to have list?
- i was pretty close to getting it done. i would have if i had more class time this last week. after i got the zombie array to work, i needed more help but we had final exams and what not.
- i got a few of the wants done so i am good with that

## most proud of
-i really liked how smooth everything is. the feeling of finally getting the zombie array done was really good, helped me out a ton for the final exam 2d array things.
- i learned a ton from this project, i struggled through a lot but just didnt have enough time to work at home, only the limited school time that i was given, but it meant a lot for my understanding of Javascript.

## overall
- i am looking forward to doing more with computers esspecially getting into uni. i really enjoyed this class, it was a lot of fun! thanks Mr. Schellenberg
- i will get this project fully done, and show it to you if possible.
- overall i liked JS better then python and it was much more fun and meaningfull!
